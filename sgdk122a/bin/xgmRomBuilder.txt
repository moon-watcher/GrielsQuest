XGMRomBuilder is a tool which allow you to build your own Sega Megadrive/Genesis ROM from VGM files (Sega Megadrive/Genesis compatible)
and play them directly on your Sega Megadrive/Genesis system through the XGM player.
Note that it does require XGMTool (which is a part of SGDK) to be located in the same folder to work properly.
If you use Unix/OSX system you need to recompile XGMTool for your OS (sources are provided in SGDK).

Usage:
------
Just build your list of music by adding VGM file, note that maximum ROM size is 4MB and maximum number of track is limited to 100.
You can set some specific options to improve the VGM --> XGM conversion process if some music doesn't sound correctly when played from the ROM.
When you're done with the list, just click on "Build ROM" button and after a while you should obtain a xgmrom.bin file in XGMBulder folder.

Changelog:

version 1.2:
- upgraded to XGMPlayer v3

version 1.1:
- compatible with Java 6
- support zipped VGM file (VGZ or ZIP)
